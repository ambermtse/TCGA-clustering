# Novel Subtyping of TCGA patients From Multimodal Analysis

This repository contains the infracstructure to build a multimodal graph of TCGA patients within Neo4j, emmulating my project done at AbbVie. The Neo4j graph contains nodes labeled with the patient's indication and named with their TCGA barcode. Undirected relationships between the nodes represent the k-Nearest Neighbors for a given node, labeled with the its modality. Patients within the same indication can be clustered together to discover novel subtypes, and correlated with biomarkers and other relevant clinical features to find new drivers of clustering. This model and pipeline allows for other data modalities to be used to calculate new Nearest Neighbors and to be added to the Neo4j graph. The notebook in this repository contains the code to calculate and add expression neighbors to the graph. In conjunction with other data modalities, we can discover novel-subtyping results to improve predicitve performance.
